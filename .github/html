    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> 1912 </strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London. </li>
      <li><strong> 1926 </strong> - Starts attending the independent Sherborne School at age 13. </li>
      <li><strong> 1934 </strong> - Graduates from Cambridge University with a first-class Honours Degree in Mathematics. </li>
      <li><strong> 1939 </strong> - With outbreak of WW2, starts working at Bletchely Park, helping to crack the 'Enigma' code being used by Nazi Germany. </li>
      <li><strong> 1948 </strong> - Appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. </li>
      <li><strong> 1949 </strong> - Becomes deputy director of the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers—the Manchester Mark 1. </li>
      <li><strong> 1950 </strong> - Introduces the 'Turing test' in a theoretical paper. The Turing test is designed to determine whether artificial intelligence is capable of human thinking. </li>
      <li><strong> 1951 </strong> - Publishes his masterpiece 'The Chemical Basis of Morpogenesis', a work that is still considered seminal in the field of mathematical biology now. </li>
      <li><strong> 1952 </strong> - Convicted of 'gross indecency' due to his relationship with Arnold Murray. Homosexual relationships were illegal at this time in the U.K. Chose probation instead of imprisonment, which was conditional on agreeing to be chemically castrated. This led to severe health effects and the removal of his security clearances, barring him from future work with GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters). </li>
      <li><strong> 1954 </strong> - Found dead at the age of 41. Inquest concludes he committed suicide through cyanide ingestion. </li>
      <li><strong> 2013 </strong> - Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect. </li>
      <li><strong> 2021 </strong> - A potrait of Turing is selected by the public as the design for the new £50 note, in honour of his contribution. </li>
